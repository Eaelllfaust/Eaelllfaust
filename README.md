Yes, I am a software engineer. 💻

```
$ cat confession.txt
```

But this is the part where I confess I have an unhealthy obsession with financial technology products. I love building them, I love maintaining them, and I ofcourse, love breaking them, just to fix them right after. Fortune favors the paranoid... and their friends (Who would have thought) 💰🔧🔨

```
$ ./company_info.sh
```

So what of it? Well I happen to found mypursepay. A company commited to growing the nigerians wealth economy. A canvas I can paint on, and leave any shred of ingenuity that can come of obsession (healthy or unhealthy). 

```
$ echo $wellwhat
```

The gentleman is something of a unicorn. Maybe cheap flattery, but I believe my portfolio judges me right. (You should find the link to it anywhere my profile image is) 🦄

An interdisciplinary designer and software developer. 🎨💻

I am Eaelll Leon Faust, and you're a proper chat.
